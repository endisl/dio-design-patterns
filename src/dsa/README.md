## KPairs

A financial analyst is responsible for a portfolio of profitable stocks represented in an array.  
Each item in the array represents the yearly profit of a corresponding stock.  
The analyst gathers all distinct pairs of stocks that reached the target profit.  
Distinct pairs are pairs that differ in at least one element.  
Given the array of profits, find the number of distinct pairs of stocks where the sum of each pair's profits is exactly equal to the target profit.  
Example:  
stocksProfit = [5, 7, 9, 13, 11, 6, 6, 3, 3]  
target = 12  
3 distinct pairs of stocks: (5,7), (3,9) and (6,6)  
Output: 3  

## KnightMoves

Given a chess board of n rows (top to bottom) and n columns (left to right).
In each move, a knight moves either:
- 2 column positions and 1 row position
- 2 row positions and 1 colummn position
In other words, a move is 2 steps along one axis and 1 step along aperpendicular axis.
Given a starting position A and ending position B, 
calculate the minimum number of moves needed by the knight to move from A to B if it is possible.
If it is not possible, return -1.
Input:
n = 9
startRow = 4
startCol = 4
endRow = 4
endCol = 8
Output: 2

## NumberWays

A box contains a number of chocolates that can only be removed 1 at a time or 3 at a time.
How many ways can the box be emptied?
The answer can be very large so return it as a modulo of 10<sup>9</sup>+7.
For example, there are n = 7 chocolates initially. They can be removed nine ways, as follows:
1. (1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
2. (1,1,1,1,3)
3. (1,1,1,3,1)
4. (1,1,3,1,1)
5. (1,3,1,1,1)
6. (3,1,1,1,1)
7. (1,3,3)
8. (3,1,3)
9. (3,3,1)
